 * who they are, they are at a keyboard, and they are not in the middle of anything yet.
 *
 * Asking is all it does. The answer "not now" is taken, and they carry on to wherever
 * they were going - the enforcement handler is what refuses to take no for an answer,
 * and this deliberately steps aside for anyone it covers.
 *
 * It asks after every login. That is a deliberate choice by the site owner rather than
 * the gentlest option available, so `fluent_auth/ask_to_set_up_totp` is here to soften
 * it without patching the plugin - return false and the asking stops.
