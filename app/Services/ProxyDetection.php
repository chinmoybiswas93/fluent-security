/**

 *
 * This only ever advises. Nothing here is allowed to widen who is trusted, because the
 * whole reason the IP resolver refuses to infer a proxy is that inferring one is what
 * lets a visitor announce their own address. What it produces is a suggestion for an
 * administrator to confirm, and - more usefully - a warning when the evidence says the
 * site is behind a proxy that has not been declared, which is a failure that otherwise
 * says nothing at all while every visitor quietly resolves to the same address.
 *
 * The two mistakes are not equally bad. Saying "proxy" when there is none costs a
 * settings panel nobody needed. Saying "no proxy" when there is one hides the only
 * screen that can fix a site where the login attempt limit is counting every visitor
 * as the same person. So the confident answer is the positive one, and the absence of
 * evidence is reported as absence of evidence.
